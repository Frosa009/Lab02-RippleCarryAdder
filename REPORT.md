For the test cases I believe i only made 2 extra I know i should have made more but honestly I am stuggling in my other classes a 
lot. The test cases i did make just test general correctness not very good.
For whatever reason as of my next and possibly last submission my gtkwave will crash whenever i try and open the file for the wave I have tried multiple different attemps and have not found a solution as of yet.
